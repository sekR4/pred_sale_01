# Sales Prediction
Predict items sold in the next 7 days for each store and item in the data set.

Edit:
This was the actual goal of this assignment. The code works fine. However, with the features used we're only able to make acceptable predictions for the next day, not for seven. I've noticed that error far too late... like one day before the interview. And when you're working full-time, you know what this means. So I failed.

However, the predictions for the next day might still be useful in another project.
